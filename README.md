# Crowdfunding Data Analysis

## Overview
Crowdfunding platforms host thousands of campaigns, yet many fail to reach their funding goals. Campaign creators are often uncertain about **which factors influence campaign success** and **why some campaigns attract more donors than others**.

This project presents an **end-to-end data science and machine learning analysis** of crowdfunding campaigns, focusing on identifying the **key drivers of campaign success** and predicting campaign outcomes using features available **at the time of campaign creation**.

## Objectives
- Analyze patterns in crowdfunding campaign performance across categories  
- Identify factors influencing **number of donations** and **campaign success**  
- Test statistical hypotheses related to donation behavior  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict campaign success  
- Address class imbalance using resampling techniques  
- Provide actionable insights for campaign creators
